					<h1>General rules</h1>
					<p>All times and schedules will be communicated in UTC.</p>
					<p>
						Players and staff are expected to remain respectful and
						sportsmanlike, both on the Discord server and during
						matches, and to abide by the osu! community TOS.
					</p>
					<a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Rules"
						>https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Rules</a
					>
					<p>
						All displays of toxicity or offenses to the competitive
						integrity of the tournament will be sanctioned by staff,
						and may be reported to the official tournament
						committee.
					</p>
					<h2>Qualifiers procedure</h2>
					<p>Qualifiers are optional.</p>
					<p>
						5 pools will be available to the players, namely Quals
						A, Quals B, Quals C, Quals D and Quals E. Each pool
						consists of 4-5 maps. Players may elect to play anywhere
						from 0 to 5 pools.
					</p>
					<p>
						Not taking part in qualifiers has no effect on your
						participation in the tournament. You may still be
						drafted by captains and play in matches as per usual. If
						you are planning on deseeding, don't waste our referee's
						(and your) time and skip qualifiers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Qualifier lobbies for each pool will be available for
						players to join at various times throughout the
						qualifier period. Players may also make requests for
						additional lobbies, which will be granted or not
						depending on staff availability.
					</p>
					<p>
						A single pool is played in each lobby. The pool will be
						played in its entirety following the order indicated on
						the mainsheet.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the event that a player disconnects during a
						qualifier map, the map will not be replayed and the
						score will be void for that map.
					</p>
					<p>
						NoFail is enforced on all qualifiers. Maps from the
						qualifier pools belong to one of the following mod
						categories: NoMod, FreeMod, Hidden, HardRock,
						DoubleTime. Maps will be played with their respective
						mod enabled. In the case of FreeMod, players may elect
						to play the map with one of the following mod
						combinations : NM, HD, HR, HDHR, EZ or EZHD (+NF).
					</p>
					<p>
						Qualifier results will be made public in real-time.
						These are purely informative and only serve to help the
						decision of draft captains, and therefore will not
						impact seeding or bracket afterwards.
					</p>
					<h2>Captain selection</h2>
					<p>
						All 16 draft captains will be hand picked by the admin
						team.
					</p>
					<p>
						The selection will be conducted fairly based on the
						following criteria : scene involvement and interest in
						being captain. Captains will be kept at a similar skill
						level.
					</p>
					<p>
						Interest in captaincy is assessed via the poll on the
						registration form. Make sure this value is correct when
						submitting your registration. Afterwards, contact an
						admin to change it no later than July 28th @ 23:59 UTC.
					</p>
					<p>
						Captains will be revealed after registrations close, at
						the same time as the qualifier pools.
					</p>
					<h2>Draft procedure</h2>
					<p>
						The draft will be scheduled on the weekend of August
						10th-11th in an accord with all captains.
					</p>
					<p>
						Should a captain be unavailable, they may select someone
						else to act as their proxy. The proxy is expected to
						communicate with the captain beforehand and act
						according to their wishes.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the draft, captains will take turns drafting
						players. The draft order will be drawn randomly. The
						draft will then proceed in a snaking manner as shown in
						the below example:
					</p>
					<p>1 → 2 → … → 15 → 16 → 16 → … → 1 → …</p>
					<p>
						During a turn, captains have 60 seconds to pick a
						player. This timer will be extended to 90 seconds for
						the last 2 rounds of picks. Should a captain fail to
						pick in the allotted time, their current pick will be
						reported to the very end of the draft, after all other
						picks (timer extension will not apply).
					</p>
					<p>
						The draft goes on until all captains have picked 7
						players to form a team of 8. All remaining undrafted
						players will not proceed to the rest of the tournament.
					</p>
					<p>
						Draft captains are allowed to pass on team captaincy to
						another player after the draft.
					</p>
					<p>
						Teams will then be assigned random seeding and placed in
						a double-elimination bracket.
					</p>
					<h2>Scheduling rules</h2>
					<p>
						During bracket, matches may be scheduled each week from
						the friday to the monday.
					</p>
					<p>
						Default match times will be issued by the admin team.
						Expect these times to be at common international times
						(e.g 12-16 UTC).
					</p>
					<p>
						A Discord channel will be created for each match.
						Opposing teams may use these channels to discuss the
						schedule of their match. Reschedules may be conducted in
						the channel, or handled in DMs and posted to the
						channel.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the event that both parties fail to reach a
						consensus, the admin team may intervene to decide on a
						fair time within the limits of official osu! tournament
						rules and common sense.
					</p>
					<p>Asynchronous matches are not allowed.</p>
					<h2>Match procedure</h2>
					<p>
						Match lobbies are created and handled by an assigned
						referee.
					</p>
					<p>
						Referees abide by the following guidelines but are
						expected to use common sense to resolve unclear
						situations when needed. Specifically, all timers
						described in this document can be extended at the
						discretion of the referee.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the captain is unavailable, they may indicate a
						substitute captain who will act as the captain for the
						match.
					</p>
					<p>Matches will proceed with the following phases:</p>
					<p>rolls → ban phase → pick phase</p>
					<p>Warmups are not allowed.</p>
					<p>
						If a team fails to have 4 players present after the ban
						phase, the win will be given by default to the opposing
						team.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once both teams are in the lobby, the captains (or
						substitute captain if applicable) roll.
					</p>
					<p>
						The winner of the roll is prompted to choose between
						pick order and ban order. They get to choose who goes
						first for the chosen order. The loser of the roll gets
						to choose the other order.
					</p>
					<p>
						After the roll, captains will state their bans in ABBA
						order. Banned maps cannot be picked by either team
						during the pick phase.
					</p>
					<p>
						Teams have 90 seconds to state their ban. Should they
						fail to do so in a timely manner, their ban is voided.
					</p>
					<p>
						During the pick phase, teams will take turns choosing a
						map to play. Each map may only be played once over the
						course of the match.
					</p>
					<p>
						Double banning (i.e banning 2 maps from the same mod
						pool) is allowed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Double picking (i.e picking 2 maps from the same mod
						pool in a row) is allowed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Teams have 90 seconds to state their pick. Should they
						fail to do so in a timely manner, they are issued a
						warning. In the event of further infringements, their
						pick is forfeit to the opposing team, without changing
						the pick sequence (i.e. opposing team would get two
						picks in a row).
					</p>
					<p>
						After picking, teams have an additional 90 seconds to
						gather exactly 4 players in the lobby and ready up.
						Similarly, should they fail to do so in a timely manner,
						they are issued a warning. In the event of further
						infringements, their point is forfeit to the opposing
						team.
					</p>
					<p>
						Should a player have a technical issue or disconnect in
						the first 30 seconds of a map, they may request an abort
						(or the referee might make one of his own). This leads
						to the current map being replayed. Only one abort is
						allowed per match and per team.
					</p>
					<p>
						For disconnects happening past the 30 seconds mark or
						after the first abort, only the following evidence may
						be used as replacement for a score missing from the mp
						link:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li style="color: white; font-weight: 700">
							a results screen screenshot with a visible timestamp
							of the time the play was set
						</li>
						<li style="color: white; font-weight: 700">
							a livestream timestamp of the score being set
							(either from the player's or the tournament's
							stream).
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Teams may also request a tactical timeout of 120 seconds
						at any point during the match, once per match and per
						team. The timeout will be applied before their next pick
						phase.
					</p>
					<h2>Tiebreaker rules</h2>
					<p>
						When both teams are 1 point away from winning the match,
						the tiebreaker procedure is called.
					</p>
					<p>
						Both team captains will, within a timer of 90 seconds,
						send an in-game private message to the referee stating
						which of the 3 tiebreaker maps they wish to ban. If they
						don't send any message, their ban is forfeit.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the teams ban different maps, the remaining map will
						be played to decide the outcome of the match.
					</p>
					<p>
						If both teams ban the same map or at least one ban has
						been forfeit, the referee will roll to choose a
						tiebreaker.
					</p>
					<p>
						Tiebreakers are played with freemod activated and NF
						enforced. They may be played with any of the following
						mod combinations: NM, HD, HR, HDHR, EZ, EZHD, without
						mod restrictions.
					</p>
					<h2>Freemod rules</h2>
					<p>These rules apply to maps from the FreeMod category.</p>
					<p>
						The following mod combinations are allowed: HD, HR,
						HDHR, EZ, EZHD.
					</p>
					<p>HDHR counts as a single mod.</p>
					<p>
						Teams are required to have at least 4 mods across the
						roster.
					</p>
					<p>
						Each team must have at least one HR/HDHR player and at
						least one HD only player.
					</p>
					<p>EZ plays have a custom multiplier of x1.7.</p>
					<p>EZHD plays have a custom multiplier of x2.3.</p>
